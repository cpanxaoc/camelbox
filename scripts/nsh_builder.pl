# - The filename match pattern (qr/gtk-core-bin/)
# - The Section name of the package ("Core GTK Binaries")

 --md5list|-m <filename> 
                    Generate an MD5 checksummed list of files.  Output file
                    will be saved as filelist.<filename>.md5.txt, or
                    filelist.DATETIME.md5.txt.  Use for creating md5sum files
                    for releases
 --nshlist|-n <filename>       
                    Generate an NSIS script listing of files.  Output file
                    will be saved as filelist.<filename>.nsh, or

#### Package 'Hump::File::Stat' ####
package Hump::File::Stat;

=pod

=head2 Module Hump::File::Stat

A wrapper around the Perl C<stat()> function.  Has the same attributes as
what's returned from the C<stat()> function, but with a little nicer naming
convention.  The following attributes are defined:  C<device>, C<inode>,
C<mode>, C<num_hardlinks>,  C<uid>, C<gid>, C<rdev> (for block/character
devices), C<size>, C<atime>, C<mtime>, C<ctime>, C<blocksize>, C<blocks>
(actual number of blocks allocated).

=cut

#### Package 'Hump::File' ####
package Hump::File;

=pod

=head2 Module Hump::File

A file on the filesystem.  Has the following attributes:

=over 5

=item stat

A C<Hump::File::Stat> object, which is a wrapper around the Perl C<stat()>
function.

=item filename 

The name of the archive file.  The file is checked to see if it exists and is
readable when an object is created from this class.

=item md5sum

The MD5 checksum for the file.  Not available for directories.

=item crcsum

The CRC32 checksum for the file.  Not available for directories.
