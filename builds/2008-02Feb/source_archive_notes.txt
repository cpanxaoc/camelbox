Instructions on where to put which files from each project's distribution
archives.  These sections appear roughly in the order you should install them
in.

Directory structure:
- build - directory for building perl
- gtk-archives - 7zipped files
- gtk-binaries - directories containing unpacked binaries from the Gnome
  website
  - gtk-core-bin
  - gtk-core-dev
  - gtk-core-doc
  - gtk-support-bin
  - gtk-support-dev
  - imagelibs-bin
  - imagelibs-dev
  - imagelibs-utils
  - 7zip
  - dmake
  - dmake-extra (unneeded files from dmake)
  - unxutils
- gtk-tarballs - downloaded archives and support software

gtk-binaries preparation
========================
- extract all of the non-dev archives to gtk-core-bin
- extract all of the -dev archives to gtk-core-dev
  - move the make files in gtk-support-dev\make to
	gtk-support-dev\share\doc\<package name> and delete the make folder
- move the contents of gtk-core-dev\share\gtk-doc\html from to
  gtk-core-doc\share\html 
- delete gtk-core-dev\share\gtk-doc

UnxUtils
========
- move everything in unxutils\usr\local to unxutils\usr
- create unxutils\usr\share\doc\unxutils\
- move StdDisclaimer.html and UnxUtilsDist.html to unxutils\share\doc\unxutils\
- move the contents of unxutils\usr\local\share to unxutils\share\doc\unxutils\
- move unxutils\usr\md5sum to unxutils\share\doc\unxutils\
- move the contents of unxutils\usr\wbin to unxutils\bin
- delete unxutils\usr\wbin
- move unxutils\bin\libfl.[a|lib] to unxutils\usr\lib, overwrite existing
  files

- copy unxutils\bin\sort.exe to unxutils\bin\usort.exe

7zip (Optional)
===============
- create 7zip\bin, 7zip\usr\share\doc\7zip

dmake
=====
- create dmake\bin, dmake\usr\share\doc\dmake
- move dmake.exe and support\ to dmake\bin
- move all of the other files/directories to dmake\share\doc\dmake
- (Optional) move all of the unneeded files/directories in dmake\bin\support
  to a dmake-extra package.

MinGW
=====
- Make sure you select g++
- Install to C:\camelbox
- move camelbox\COPYING* and camelbox\MinGW shortcut to camelbox\doc

- move camelbox\doc to camelbox\share\
- move all of the MinGW files into the camelbox\share\doc\mingw-runtime
  directory

You now have enough software installed to build Perl.  Unpack the source, and
use dmake to build.

- html directory can be packaged/deleted?

gtk-support programs

libiconv
- required by pkg-config to run
- move libiconv\bin and libiconv\share\locale to gtk-support-bin\
- move contents of libiconv\share\doc\libiconv to
  gtk-support-dev\usr\share\doc\libiconv
- move libiconv\share\man to gtk-suport-dev\usr\man
- move libiconv\README.libiconv to gtk-support-dev\usr\share\doc\libiconv
- move libiconv\lib and libiconv\share to gtk-support-dev\

pkg-config
- extract to gtk-support-bin
