# Camelbox #

A complete build of Perl for 32-bit Windows that includes:

- A nice Windows installer that automatically downloads and installs the
  correct archive files
- All of the core Gtk2-Perl modules (Gtk2, Glib, Cairo), as well as their
  equivalent C libraries compiled for Windows.
- A working CPAN module
- Bonus (!) Perl modules, including DBI/DBD[SQLite|mysql|Pg|ODBC] and friends
- Extra binaries, utilities, development libraries/headers for compiling even
  more Perl modules from CPAN
- Lots of Perl/GTK documenation in HTML format
- Windows shortcuts for applications, demos, documentation, and links to
  documentation/tutorials on the web

all neatly packaged and ready to install!
